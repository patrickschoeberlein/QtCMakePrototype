QtCMakePrototype
================

a starting point for simple Qt projects with CMake

Qt itself is not included, download at http://qt-project.org/downloads

to built Qt yourself see https://qt-project.org/wiki/Building_Qt_Desktop_for_Windows_with_MinGW

if CMake does not find the Qt library itself, it needs a path (Qt5Widgets_DIR) - for the prebuilt MinGW+OpenGL version from qt-project.org the path should look like C:\Qt\Qt5.3.1\5.3\mingw482_32\lib\cmake\Qt5Widgets
